# Basic Responsive Multi-Page Website using ReactJS

The goal of this project is to provide a starting point for creating a multi-page website using the ReactJS library. ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it's commonly used for single-page applications (SPAs). However, with the addition of routing, you can create a multi-page website within a React application.
This project is a basic template for creating a responsive multi-page website using ReactJS. It provides a simple structure for building a website with multiple pages and responsive design.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your local machine.
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred editor.
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Familiarity with ReactJS is a plus but not mandatory.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Basic-Responsive-MultiPage-Website-ReactJS.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Basic-Responsive-MultiPage-Website-ReactJS
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ Header.js
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.js
â”‚      â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ Home.js
â”‚      â”œâ”€â”€ About.js
â”‚      â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- `src/Navbar & Footer/`: Contains React components like Header and Footer.
- `src/`: Contains individual page components like Home, About, etc.
- `src/App.js`: The main application component that handles routing and page rendering.
- `src/index.js`: Entry point of the application.
- `public/`: Static assets and the `index.html` file.

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your website.
